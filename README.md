# Anti-Computation-Physics-B-Artificial-Neural-Network-Project 0.22.2

##Attention
This is a responsity for any one who is bothered by ZRY's computation physics B-Neural network homework, not aim to teach you about the true CNN/DNN or SML/SDL knowledge,anyone who use this into business will be claimed and anyone who want to report it as abusement will be claimed by all USTCers, at the same time, this responsity will be turned into secret and unfree.

##Q&A

###How to use?

download the code packet as .zip, then unzip it put all .py files into your project root filefolder, make sure your IDE will find it when you want to use it in your codes

when you want to train a neural network, just use import key word in your code file(.py), just do it as this way:

```python
N1=KERAS_NeuralNet()
N1.KERASNeuralEngine()
```

Tips:   Do not think that it's out of the command of teacher when you use keras neural network frame, actually you need to konw that Tensorflow 2.X edtion uses almost whole keras system codes and engines, that is to say, you can view Tensorflow 2.X edition as the same as keras, if ZRY/WYS or anybody query your codes, nothing will be clarified except for the truth that he/she is a f*** asshead.
